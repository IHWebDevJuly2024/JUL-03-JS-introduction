# JS introduction
## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 

This `programming language` is widely used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. It basically translates the code written by the developer into a language that the web browser can understand.

## Can JavaScript be used outside of web browsers?
Yes, JavaScript can be used outside of web browsers with Node.js, a runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed out of the browser.

In this lesson, we've learned about data types, variables, and operators in JavaScript. We've also learned about the importance of comments and how to write them in our code.
